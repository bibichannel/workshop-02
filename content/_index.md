### Overview

With [Workshop 01](https://bibichannel.github.io/workshop-01/), we guide you to develop and automatically deploy a static website on AWS cloud using services like Cloud9, S3, CodePipeline, CloudFront, Route53, etc.

In Workshop 02, we will explore how to provision infrastructure on AWS as code using an open-source tool, Terraform, developed by HashiCorp. Additionally, we will look at how to integrate AWS serverless services, CI/CD, monitoring, and management.

Let's take a look at the diagram below to get an overview of this workshop.
